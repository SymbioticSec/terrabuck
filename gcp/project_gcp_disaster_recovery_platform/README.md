# Enterprise Disaster Recovery Orchestration Platform

A comprehensive disaster recovery platform that automates backup orchestration, recovery testing, and failover procedures for enterprise applications. Built for enterprises requiring RTO/RPO guarantees and regulatory compliance for business continuity.

## Architecture Overview

This platform implements a multi-region disaster recovery solution with the following components:

- **Backup Orchestration Engine**: Coordinates backup schedules and monitors application health
- **Backup Storage**: Multi-region storage for application backups and recovery artifacts
- **Recovery Database**: Stores recovery procedures, backup metadata, and compliance logs
- **Recovery Testing Service**: Automated recovery testing and RTO/RPO measurement
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time dashboard for DR teams and compliance reporting
- **Notification Service**: Alert distribution and escalation procedures

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled
- Terraform >= 1.0 installed
- `gcloud` CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Required GCP APIs enabled:
  - Compute Engine API
  - Cloud SQL API
  - Cloud Storage API
  - Cloud Functions API
  - Pub/Sub API

## Required Permissions

The deploying user/service account needs the following roles:
- `roles/compute.admin`
- `roles/storage.admin`
- `roles/cloudsql.admin`
- `roles/cloudfunctions.admin`
- `roles/pubsub.admin`
- `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin`

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone and prepare the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd disaster-recovery-platform
   ```

2. **Create function source files**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p functions
   # Create placeholder function zip files
   echo "# Recovery testing function" > functions/main.py
   zip functions/testing-function.zip functions/main.py
   zip functions/notification-function.zip functions/main.py
   ```

3. **Create startup scripts**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p scripts
   cat > scripts/orchestration-startup.sh << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
   pip3 install google-cloud-storage google-cloud-sql
   # Add orchestration engine setup here
   EOF
   
   cat > scripts/dashboard-startup.sh << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y nginx python3 python3-pip
   pip3 install flask google-cloud-sql
   # Add dashboard setup here
   EOF
   ```

4. **Set up Terraform variables**:
   ```bash
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   ```

   Edit `terraform.tfvars`:
   ```hcl
   project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"
   primary_region = "us-central1"
   secondary_region = "us-east1"
   db_password = "your-secure-database-password"
   environment = "prod"
   ```

5. **Deploy the infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

6. **Verify deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Check compute instances
   gcloud compute instances list --filter="name~'enterprise-disaster-recovery'"
   
   # Check storage buckets
   gcloud storage buckets list --filter="name~'enterprise-disaster-recovery'"
   
   # Check database instance
   gcloud sql instances list --filter="name~'enterprise-disaster-recovery'"
   ```

## Post-Deployment Configuration

1. **Configure Database Schema**:
   ```bash
   # Connect to the database and create initial schema
   gcloud sql connect enterprise-disaster-recovery-orchestration-platform-database-recovery --user=dr_admin
   ```

2. **Set up Monitoring**:
   - Access the monitoring dashboard at the IP provided in outputs
   - Configure alert thresholds and notification channels
   - Set up backup schedules through the orchestration engine

3. **Test Recovery Procedures**:
   - Trigger the recovery testing function via Pub/Sub
   - Verify backup and restore procedures
   - Document RTO/RPO measurements

## Security Considerations

This deployment includes several security configurations:
- VPC with private subnets for component isolation
- Service accounts with least privilege access
- Database encryption and access controls
- Network firewall rules
- Flow logging for audit trails

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Monitor backup success rates through the dashboard
- Review recovery test results regularly
- Update recovery procedures based on application changes
- Maintain compliance documentation and audit trails

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Function deployment failures**: Ensure source zip files exist in the functions directory
2. **Database connection issues**: Verify firewall rules and authorized networks
3. **Storage access problems**: Check service account permissions and IAM bindings

## Cost Optimization

- Review storage lifecycle policies regularly
- Monitor compute instance utilization
- Consider using preemptible instances for testing workloads
- Implement automated resource cleanup for test environments

## Compliance and Auditing

The platform maintains audit trails for:
- Backup operations and schedules
- Recovery test results and metrics
- Access logs and authentication events
- Configuration changes and approvals

## Support and Documentation

For additional support:
- Review GCP documentation for individual services
- Check Terraform provider documentation
- Monitor platform logs through Cloud Logging
- Contact your cloud architecture team for customizations

## Cleanup

To destroy the infrastructure:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

**Warning**: This will permanently delete all resources including backups and databases. Ensure you have exported any critical data before proceeding.
