# Autonomous Drone Delivery Management Platform

This Terraform configuration deploys a comprehensive platform for managing autonomous drone delivery operations on Google Cloud Platform.

## Architecture Overview

The platform implements an event-driven microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Drone Telemetry Ingestion**: Cloud Function for processing real-time drone data
- **Flight Coordination Engine**: Compute Engine instance for flight path optimization
- **Delivery Tracking API**: Cloud Run service for customer-facing tracking
- **Operational Database**: Cloud SQL PostgreSQL for core data storage
- **Telemetry Data Lake**: Cloud Storage for long-term telemetry storage
- **Compliance Reporting**: Cloud Function for FAA compliance reports

## Prerequisites

1. Google Cloud Project with billing enabled
2. Terraform >= 1.0 installed
3. Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated
4. Required APIs enabled:
   - Compute Engine API
   - Cloud SQL API
   - Cloud Storage API
   - Cloud Functions API
   - Cloud Run API
   - IAM API

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Enable Required APIs

```bash
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
```

### 2. Set Up Terraform Variables

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file:

```hcl
project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"
region     = "us-central1"
zone       = "us-central1-a"
domain     = "your-company.com"
db_password = "your-secure-database-password"
environment = "dev"
```

### 3. Initialize and Deploy

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan the deployment
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply
```

### 4. Verify Deployment

After deployment, verify the components:

```bash
# Check Cloud Functions
gcloud functions list

# Check Cloud Run services
gcloud run services list

# Check Compute instances
gcloud compute instances list

# Check Cloud SQL instances
gcloud sql instances list
```

## Component Details

### Flight Coordination Engine
- **Type**: Compute Engine (e2-medium)
- **Purpose**: Core flight path optimization and collision avoidance
- **Network**: Private subnet with external IP for management
- **Security**: Service account with minimal required permissions

### Operational Database
- **Type**: Cloud SQL PostgreSQL 14
- **Purpose**: Stores delivery orders, drone fleet data, flight logs
- **Backup**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Security**: SSL connections, authorized networks

### Telemetry Data Lake
- **Type**: Cloud Storage
- **Purpose**: Long-term storage of drone telemetry and flight data
- **Lifecycle**: Automatic deletion after 90 days
- **Versioning**: Enabled for data integrity

### API Services
- **Telemetry Ingestion**: HTTP-triggered Cloud Function (Python 3.9)
- **Delivery Tracking**: Cloud Run service with auto-scaling
- **Compliance Reporting**: Scheduled Cloud Function for FAA reports

## Network Architecture

- **VPC**: Custom VPC with three subnets
  - Public subnet (10.0.1.0/24): API endpoints
  - Private subnet (10.0.2.0/24): Internal services
  - Data subnet (10.0.3.0/24): Database tier
- **Firewall**: Controlled access for SSH and HTTP/HTTPS
- **Load Balancer**: Global load balancer for API endpoints

## Security Features

- Service accounts with principle of least privilege
- Network segmentation with private subnets
- SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit
- Automated backup and versioning
- Audit logging enabled
- Shielded VM instances for compute resources

## Monitoring and Logging

The platform includes:
- Cloud Logging for all services
- Health checks for load balancer endpoints
- Database query logging
- Function execution logs

## Cost Optimization

- Lifecycle policies for storage buckets
- Auto-scaling for Cloud Run services
- Appropriate machine types for workloads
- Coldline storage for compliance archives

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Monitor database performance and optimize queries
2. Review and rotate service account keys
3. Update function dependencies and runtime versions
4. Review firewall rules and access patterns

### Backup and Recovery
- Database: Automated daily backups with 7-day retention
- Storage: Versioning enabled with lifecycle management
- Configuration: Terraform state stored securely

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Function deployment fails**: Check that source code is properly zipped
2. **Database connection issues**: Verify authorized networks and SSL settings
3. **API access denied**: Check IAM permissions and service account configuration

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Check function logs
gcloud functions logs read drone_telemetry_ingestion

# Connect to database
gcloud sql connect operational-database --user=drone_admin

# Check Cloud Run logs
gcloud run services logs read delivery-tracking-api
```

## Security Considerations

This deployment includes several security configurations that should be reviewed:
- Firewall rules allowing broad access
- Database network configuration
- IAM permissions and user access
- SSL/TLS settings

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section
2. Review Google Cloud documentation
3. Contact your platform administrator
