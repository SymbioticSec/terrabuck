# Real-time Financial Trading Platform

This Terraform configuration deploys a high-frequency trading platform on Google Cloud Platform that processes real-time market data feeds, executes algorithmic trading strategies, and provides risk management capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

The platform consists of the following components:

- **Market Data Ingester**: Cloud Run service that ingests real-time market data from exchanges
- **Trading Engine**: High-performance compute instance running algorithmic trading strategies
- **Risk Manager**: Cloud Function for real-time risk calculation and position monitoring
- **Trading Database**: PostgreSQL instance storing trade history and risk metrics
- **Message Queue**: Pub/Sub topics for distributing market data and trade signals
- **Market Data Storage**: Cloud Storage bucket for historical market data

## Network Architecture

- **VPC**: Single VPC with three subnets
  - Public subnet (10.0.1.0/24): Load balancers and external access
  - Private subnet (10.0.2.0/24): Application services
  - Data subnet (10.0.3.0/24): Database with no internet access

## Prerequisites

1. Google Cloud Project with billing enabled
2. Terraform >= 1.0 installed
3. Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated
4. Required APIs enabled:
   - Compute Engine API
   - Cloud SQL API
   - Cloud Run API
   - Cloud Functions API
   - Pub/Sub API
   - VPC Access API

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone and prepare the configuration:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository>
   cd real-time-trading-platform
   ```

2. **Create terraform.tfvars file:**
   ```hcl
   project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"
   region = "us-central1"
   zone = "us-central1-a"
   db_password = "your-secure-database-password"
   organization_domain = "your-organization.com"
   ```

3. **Prepare function source code:**
   ```bash
   # Create a dummy function source zip file
   echo "def process_risk(event, context): pass" > main.py
   zip risk-manager-source.zip main.py
   ```

4. **Create startup script for trading engine:**
   ```bash
   cat > startup-script.sh << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
   # Add your trading engine installation commands here
   EOF
   ```

5. **Initialize and deploy:**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

## Post-Deployment Configuration

1. **Build and deploy container images:**
   ```bash
   # Build market data ingester image
   gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/market-data-ingester:latest ./market-data-ingester/

   # Update Cloud Run service with new image
   gcloud run services update market-data-ingester --region=us-central1
   ```

2. **Configure database schema:**
   ```bash
   # Connect to database and create tables
   gcloud sql connect trading-database --user=trading_app
   ```

3. **Set up monitoring and alerting:**
   - Configure Cloud Monitoring dashboards
   - Set up alerting policies for trading metrics
   - Enable audit logging

## Security Considerations

This deployment includes several security configurations:

- Private IP for database instance
- VPC isolation for components
- Service account-based authentication
- Encrypted storage and transit
- Firewall rules for network access control

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Database backups**: Automated daily backups configured
- **Storage lifecycle**: 90-day retention policy for market data
- **Scaling**: Cloud Run auto-scales based on demand
- **Logging**: All components log to Cloud Logging

## Cost Optimization

- Use preemptible instances where appropriate
- Configure storage lifecycle policies
- Monitor and optimize Pub/Sub message retention
- Review and adjust compute instance sizes based on usage

## Troubleshooting

1. **Database connection issues**: Check VPC peering and firewall rules
2. **Function timeouts**: Increase memory allocation and timeout settings
3. **Pub/Sub message delays**: Check subscription acknowledgment settings
4. **High latency**: Review network configuration and instance types

## Cleanup

To destroy all resources:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

**Warning**: This will permanently delete all data and resources.
