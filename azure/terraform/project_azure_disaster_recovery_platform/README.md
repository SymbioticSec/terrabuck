# Enterprise Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Platform

This Terraform configuration deploys a comprehensive disaster recovery platform for enterprise applications on Microsoft Azure. The platform provides automated backup orchestration, cross-region replication, recovery testing, and compliance reporting capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

The platform implements a multi-region disaster recovery solution with the following components:

### Core Components

1. **DR Orchestration Engine** (`azurerm_linux_function_app`)
   - Serverless orchestration for backup schedules and failover procedures
   - Manages recovery testing workflows and replication monitoring

2. **Backup Storage** (`azurerm_storage_account`)
   - Geo-redundant storage for application backups and recovery artifacts
   - Cross-region replication with immutable blob policies

3. **Recovery Database** (`azurerm_mssql_database`)
   - Stores DR policies, recovery procedures, and compliance metadata
   - Tracks RTO/RPO metrics with automated geo-replication

4. **Monitoring Analytics** (`azurerm_log_analytics_workspace`)
   - Centralized logging for DR operations and infrastructure health
   - Compliance reporting and automated alerting

5. **DR Web Portal** (`azurerm_linux_web_app`)
   - Management interface for DR administrators
   - Policy configuration and compliance dashboards

6. **Notification Service** (`azurerm_communication_service`)
   - Multi-channel notifications for DR events and alerts
   - Email, SMS, and Teams integration

### Network Architecture

- **Multi-region VNet setup** with primary (East US) and secondary (West US 2) regions
- **Security zones**: Web, Compute, Data, and Management subnets
- **Network Security Groups** with appropriate rules for each tier
- **Private endpoints** for secure service-to-service communication

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Appropriate Azure permissions for resource creation
- SQL Server administrator credentials

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Clone and Initialize

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd disaster-recovery-platform
terraform init
```

### 2. Configure Variables

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file:

```hcl
project_name = "drplatform"
environment = "prod"
primary_location = "East US"
secondary_location = "West US 2"
sql_admin_username = "sqladmin"
sql_admin_password = "YourSecurePassword123!"

common_tags = {
  Project     = "Enterprise Disaster Recovery Platform"
  Environment = "Production"
  Owner       = "DR Team"
  CostCenter  = "IT-Infrastructure"
  Compliance  = "SOX-GDPR"
}
```

### 3. Plan and Deploy

```bash
# Review the deployment plan
terraform plan

# Deploy the infrastructure
terraform apply
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Configuration

After successful deployment:

1. **Configure Function App**: Deploy DR orchestration code to the Function App
2. **Database Setup**: Initialize the recovery database schema and seed data
3. **Web Portal**: Deploy the DR management portal application
4. **Monitoring**: Configure Log Analytics queries and alert rules
5. **Notifications**: Set up communication service endpoints and contact lists

## Resource Naming Convention

Resources follow the pattern: `{resource-type}-{project-name}-{component}-{environment}`

Examples:
- `func-drplatform-orchestration-prod`
- `sqldb-drplatform-recovery-prod`
- `st-drplatform-backup-prod`

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Features

- Network Security Groups with restrictive rules
- SQL Server with TDE encryption
- Storage account with geo-redundant replication
- Application Insights for monitoring and alerting
- Resource-level tagging for compliance tracking

### Required Post-Deployment Security Tasks

1. **Enable Azure AD Authentication** for App Services
2. **Configure Key Vault** for secrets management
3. **Set up Private Endpoints** for storage and database access
4. **Enable Advanced Threat Protection** for SQL Database
5. **Configure Web Application Firewall** for the web portal
6. **Implement RBAC** with least-privilege access

## Compliance and Monitoring

The platform supports compliance requirements for:
- **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley)**: Audit trails and data retention policies
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy controls
- **Industry Standards**: RTO/RPO tracking and reporting

### Key Metrics Tracked

- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Maximum acceptable data loss
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Maximum acceptable downtime
- Backup success rates and replication status
- Compliance audit trails and access logs

## Cost Optimization

Estimated monthly costs (East US region):
- Function App (P1v2): ~$73
- SQL Database (S2): ~$30
- Storage Accounts: ~$50
- App Service (P1v2): ~$73
- Log Analytics: ~$25
- Communication Services: Pay-per-use

**Total estimated monthly cost: ~$251** (excluding data transfer and usage-based charges)

## Disaster Recovery Testing

The platform includes automated DR testing capabilities:

1. **Scheduled Recovery Tests**: Automated failover simulations
2. **RTO/RPO Validation**: Performance metric verification
3. **Compliance Reporting**: Automated audit trail generation
4. **Rollback Procedures**: Safe return to primary operations

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

- Monitor backup success rates and storage utilization
- Review and update DR policies and procedures
- Test failover procedures quarterly
- Update compliance reports and audit trails
- Rotate access keys and certificates

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Function App Timeout**: Increase timeout settings in host.json
2. **Storage Access Issues**: Verify network rules and access keys
3. **Database Connection Failures**: Check firewall rules and connection strings
4. **Monitoring Gaps**: Validate Log Analytics workspace configuration

## Contributing

1. Follow Azure naming conventions
2. Update documentation for any architectural changes
3. Test all changes in a development environment
4. Ensure compliance with security and governance policies
