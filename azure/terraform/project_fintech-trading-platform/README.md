# Real-Time Financial Trading Platform Infrastructure

This Terraform configuration deploys a complete real-time financial trading platform on Microsoft Azure, designed for a mid-sized financial services firm processing high-volume trading operations.

## Architecture Overview

The platform implements a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Trading Web Frontend**: React-based dashboard hosted on Azure App Service
- **API Gateway**: Azure API Management for centralized API routing and security
- **Trading Engine**: Containerized core trading engine on Azure Container Instances
- **Portfolio Service**: Serverless portfolio analytics using Azure Functions
- **Trading Database**: Azure SQL Database for persistent data storage
- **Market Data Cache**: Azure Redis Cache for high-performance data caching
- **CDN Distribution**: Azure CDN for global content delivery

## Network Architecture

- **Public Subnet**: App Service and CDN endpoints
- **Private Subnet**: Container instances and function apps
- **Data Subnet**: SQL Database and Redis cache
- **Network Security Groups**: Traffic control and security policies

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Terraform >= 1.0 installed
- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- SQL Server administrator password (minimum 8 characters)

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone and Navigate**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd fintech-trading-platform
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Configure Variables**
   Create a `terraform.tfvars` file:
   ```hcl
   resource_group_name = "rg-trading-platform-prod"
   location           = "East US"
   environment        = "prod"
   sql_admin_username = "sqladmin"
   sql_admin_password = "YourSecurePassword123!"
   publisher_email    = "admin@yourcompany.com"
   ```

4. **Plan Deployment**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. **Verify Deployment**
   Check the outputs for service URLs and connection details.

## Security Considerations

This platform handles sensitive financial data and implements multiple security layers:

- **Network Isolation**: Multi-tier VNet with security groups
- **Data Encryption**: TLS encryption for data in transit
- **Access Control**: Azure AD integration and RBAC
- **Secrets Management**: Azure Key Vault for sensitive data
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Compliance**: SOX, PCI-DSS, and financial regulatory standards

## Post-Deployment Configuration

1. **Configure API Management**
   - Set up API policies and rate limiting
   - Configure OAuth 2.0 authentication
   - Import API definitions

2. **Database Setup**
   - Run database migration scripts
   - Configure backup policies
   - Set up monitoring alerts

3. **Application Deployment**
   - Deploy trading engine container image
   - Deploy portfolio service function code
   - Deploy web frontend application

4. **Security Hardening**
   - Review and update network security group rules
   - Configure Key Vault access policies
   - Enable advanced threat protection

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Azure Monitor**: Application and infrastructure monitoring
- **Log Analytics**: Centralized logging and analysis
- **Application Insights**: Application performance monitoring
- **Security Center**: Security posture management

## Cost Optimization

- Monitor resource utilization using Azure Cost Management
- Consider reserved instances for predictable workloads
- Implement auto-scaling for variable demand
- Regular review of resource sizing and SKUs

## Disaster Recovery

- **Database Backups**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Geo-Redundancy**: Consider geo-redundant storage for critical data
- **Multi-Region**: Plan for multi-region deployment for high availability
- **Recovery Testing**: Regular disaster recovery testing procedures

## Compliance and Auditing

- **Audit Logs**: Comprehensive audit trail for all operations
- **Data Retention**: Configurable data retention policies
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Built-in support for financial reporting requirements
- **Access Reviews**: Regular access permission reviews

## Support and Troubleshooting

For issues with the infrastructure:

1. Check Azure Resource Health in the portal
2. Review Application Insights for application errors
3. Check Log Analytics for system logs
4. Verify network connectivity between components

## Resource Cleanup

To destroy the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

**Warning**: This will permanently delete all resources and data. Ensure you have proper backups before proceeding.

## Contributing

1. Follow infrastructure as code best practices
2. Test changes in a development environment first
3. Update documentation for any architectural changes
4. Ensure security reviews for all modifications
