# Legal Document Management Platform - Azure Infrastructure

This Terraform configuration deploys a secure, production-ready legal document management platform on Microsoft Azure. The platform is designed for mid-size law firms (50-200 attorneys) to digitize their document management process while ensuring client confidentiality and maintaining attorney-client privilege.

## Architecture Overview

The platform implements a three-tier architecture with the following components:

### Core Components
- **Web Application**: Azure App Service hosting the document management interface
- **Document Storage**: Azure Storage Account with encrypted blob storage and versioning
- **Metadata Database**: Azure SQL Database for document metadata and audit logs
- **Search Service**: Azure Cognitive Search for full-text document search
- **Application Gateway**: Load balancer with WAF protection and SSL termination
- **Key Vault**: Centralized secrets and encryption key management

### Network Architecture
- **Public Subnet**: Application Gateway with internet access
- **Private Subnet**: App Service with VNet integration
- **Data Subnet**: Database and storage with service endpoints
- **Network Security Groups**: Layered security controls

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure CLI**: Install and configure Azure CLI
2. **Terraform**: Version >= 1.0
3. **Azure Subscription**: With appropriate permissions to create resources
4. **Service Principal**: For Terraform authentication (recommended for production)

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Clone and Configure

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd legal-document-management-platform
```

### Step 2: Set Required Variables

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file:

```hcl
resource_group_name = "rg-legal-platform-prod"
location           = "East US"
environment        = "prod"
sql_admin_username = "sqladmin"
sql_admin_password = "YourSecurePassword123!"
```

### Step 3: Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### Step 4: Plan Deployment

```bash
terraform plan
```

### Step 5: Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
terraform apply
```

## Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Configure App Service Authentication
- Set up Azure AD authentication for the web application
- Configure role-based access control (RBAC)

### 2. Upload Application Code
- Deploy the legal document management application to the App Service
- Configure connection strings using Key Vault references

### 3. Configure Search Indexing
- Set up search indexers to process documents from blob storage
- Configure OCR processing for scanned documents

### 4. Set Up Monitoring
- Configure Application Insights for application monitoring
- Set up alerts for security events and performance issues

## Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All data encrypted using Azure-managed keys
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **Network Isolation**: Private endpoints and VNet integration
- **Access Controls**: RBAC and Key Vault access policies

### Compliance Features
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity logs
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automated backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Immutable Storage**: Legal hold capabilities for compliance

## Resource Naming Convention

Resources follow the pattern: `legal-document-management-platform-{resource-type}-{identifier}`

## Estimated Costs

Monthly cost estimate for production deployment:
- App Service Plan (P1v2): ~$146
- SQL Database (S2): ~$75
- Storage Account: ~$50
- Application Gateway (WAF_v2): ~$246
- Cognitive Search (Standard): ~$250
- Key Vault: ~$3
- **Total**: ~$770/month

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor Key Vault secret expiration dates
- Review and update WAF rules
- Update application dependencies
- Review access logs and audit trails

### Security Updates
- Apply security patches to App Service runtime
- Update Terraform provider versions
- Review and update network security group rules

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **App Service Cannot Connect to Database**
   - Verify VNet integration is configured
   - Check SQL firewall rules and VNet rules

2. **Storage Access Issues**
   - Verify managed identity permissions
   - Check storage account network rules

3. **Key Vault Access Denied**
   - Verify access policies are configured correctly
   - Check managed identity assignments
