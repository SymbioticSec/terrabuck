# Automated Employee Onboarding Platform

This Terraform configuration deploys a comprehensive employee onboarding automation platform on AWS. The system handles document collection and verification, automated account provisioning, compliance training tracking, and IT asset assignment.

## Architecture Overview

The platform consists of the following components:

- **Document Storage**: S3 bucket for secure storage of employee documents and compliance materials
- **Onboarding API**: Lambda function handling onboarding workflows and system integrations
- **Employee Database**: RDS PostgreSQL database storing employee records and audit trails
- **Web Application**: Auto-scaled EC2 instances running the React-based web interface
- **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer distributing traffic with health checks
- **Task Queue**: SQS queue managing asynchronous processing of onboarding tasks

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform >= 1.0 installed
- An existing EC2 Key Pair for SSH access to instances

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone and Navigate**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd employee-onboarding-platform
   ```

2. **Configure Variables**
   Create a `terraform.tfvars` file:
   ```hcl
   aws_region      = "us-west-2"
   environment     = "production"
   key_pair_name   = "your-existing-key-pair"
   db_password     = "YourSecurePassword123!"
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Plan Deployment**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. **Access the Application**
   After deployment, access the web application using the load balancer DNS name:
   ```bash
   terraform output load_balancer_dns
   ```

## Configuration Details

### Network Architecture
- VPC with public and private subnets across two availability zones
- Public subnets host the Application Load Balancer
- Private subnets host EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and RDS database
- Internet Gateway provides outbound internet access

### Security Features
- KMS encryption for data at rest
- Security groups with least-privilege access
- VPC isolation for database and Lambda functions
- SSL/TLS termination at the load balancer

### High Availability
- Multi-AZ deployment across two availability zones
- Auto Scaling Group maintains desired instance count
- RDS automated backups and maintenance windows
- Load balancer health checks ensure traffic routing to healthy instances

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Load balancer performs health checks on `/health` endpoint
- Auto Scaling Group replaces unhealthy instances automatically

### Backup Strategy
- RDS automated backups with 7-day retention
- S3 versioning enabled for document history
- Database maintenance window: Sunday 04:00-05:00 UTC

### Scaling
- Auto Scaling Group: 1-3 instances based on demand
- RDS storage auto-scaling up to 100GB
- Lambda functions scale automatically with demand

## Resource Naming Convention

All resources follow the naming pattern:
`automated-employee-onboarding-platform-{resource-type}-{identifier}`

## Cleanup

To destroy all resources:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

**Warning**: This will permanently delete all data including the database and S3 bucket contents.

## Support

For issues or questions regarding this deployment, please refer to the project documentation or contact the infrastructure team.

## Security Considerations

This deployment includes several security best practices:
- Encryption at rest using KMS
- Network isolation using VPC and security groups
- Secrets management through Terraform variables
- Access logging and audit trails

Ensure you review and customize security settings based on your organization's requirements.
