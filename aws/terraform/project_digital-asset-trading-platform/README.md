# Digital Asset Trading Platform Infrastructure

This Terraform configuration deploys a complete digital asset trading platform infrastructure on AWS, implementing a secure, high-performance cryptocurrency and digital asset trading system.

## Architecture Overview

The platform consists of the following components:

- **Secure Network (VPC)**: Multi-AZ VPC with public, private, and data subnets
- **Trading Engine Cluster (ECS)**: Containerized trading engine with auto-scaling
- **Market Data Cache (ElastiCache Redis)**: In-memory cache for real-time market data
- **Trade Database (RDS PostgreSQL)**: ACID-compliant database for trade records
- **API Gateway**: Rate-limited REST API endpoints for trading operations
- **User Authentication (Cognito)**: Multi-factor authentication and access control
- **Compliance Storage (S3)**: Encrypted storage for KYC documents and audit logs

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform >= 1.0 installed
- Sufficient AWS permissions to create VPC, ECS, RDS, ElastiCache, API Gateway, Cognito, S3, and IAM resources

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone and Navigate**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd digital-asset-trading-platform
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Review and Customize Variables**
   ```bash
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   # Edit terraform.tfvars with your specific values
   ```

4. **Plan Deployment**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   terraform output
   ```

## Configuration Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `aws_region` | AWS region for deployment | `us-west-2` |
| `environment` | Environment name | `prod` |
| `vpc_cidr` | VPC CIDR block | `10.0.0.0/16` |
| `db_username` | Database master username | `trading_admin` |

## Security Features

- **Network Isolation**: Multi-tier VPC with security groups
- **Encryption**: KMS encryption for databases and S3 storage
- **Authentication**: Cognito with MFA enforcement
- **Access Control**: IAM roles and policies with least privilege
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logging and container insights

## High Availability

- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Resources distributed across availability zones
- **Auto Scaling**: ECS services with automatic scaling policies
- **Database Clustering**: Aurora PostgreSQL with read replicas
- **Cache Redundancy**: Redis with automatic failover

## Compliance and Auditing

- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging across all services
- **Data Retention**: Configurable backup and retention policies
- **Regulatory Compliance**: KYC document storage and audit capabilities
- **Access Logging**: Detailed access logs for all components

## Monitoring and Observability

- **CloudWatch Integration**: Metrics and logs for all services
- **Container Insights**: Detailed ECS cluster monitoring
- **Database Monitoring**: RDS Performance Insights
- **API Monitoring**: API Gateway request/response logging

## Disaster Recovery

- **Automated Backups**: Daily database and configuration backups
- **Cross-Region Replication**: S3 compliance data replication
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete infrastructure reproducibility
- **Recovery Procedures**: Documented recovery processes

## Cost Optimization

- **Right-Sizing**: Appropriately sized instances for workload
- **Reserved Capacity**: Recommendations for reserved instances
- **Auto Scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on demand
- **Storage Lifecycle**: Automated data archiving policies

## Maintenance

- **Updates**: Regular security patches and updates
- **Scaling**: Monitor and adjust capacity as needed
- **Backup Verification**: Regular backup restoration testing
- **Security Reviews**: Periodic security assessments

## Cleanup

To destroy the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

**Warning**: This will permanently delete all resources and data. Ensure you have proper backups before proceeding.
