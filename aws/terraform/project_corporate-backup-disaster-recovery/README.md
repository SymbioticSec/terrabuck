# Corporate Backup and Disaster Recovery System

This Terraform configuration deploys a comprehensive enterprise backup and disaster recovery solution for a mid-sized corporation with 500+ employees. The system provides automated daily backups, cross-region replication, and secure restore capabilities with audit logging.

## Architecture Overview

The system implements the following components:

- **Primary Backup Storage**: S3 bucket with versioning and lifecycle policies
- **Disaster Recovery Storage**: Cross-region replicated S3 bucket for long-term retention
- **Backup Orchestration**: Lambda functions for backup job orchestration and monitoring
- **Backup Metadata Database**: RDS MySQL database storing backup metadata and job status
- **Backup Gateway**: EC2 instance serving as secure gateway for on-premises backup agents
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: CloudWatch and CloudTrail for centralized monitoring and alerting

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform >= 1.0 installed
- Access to two AWS regions (primary and DR)

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone and Navigate**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd corporate-backup-disaster-recovery
   ```

2. **Create terraform.tfvars**:
   ```hcl
   primary_region = "us-east-1"
   dr_region      = "us-west-2"
   environment    = "prod"
   db_password    = "YourSecurePassword123!"
   ```

3. **Create Lambda Deployment Package**:
   ```bash
   # Create a simple Lambda function zip file
   echo 'def handler(event, context): return {"statusCode": 200}' > index.py
   zip backup_orchestration.zip index.py
   ```

4. **Create User Data Script**:
   ```bash
   cat > user_data.sh << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   yum update -y
   yum install -y aws-cli
   # Configure backup gateway software here
   EOF
   ```

5. **Initialize and Deploy**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

## Configuration

### Network Architecture

- **VPC**: 10.0.0.0/16 with DNS support enabled
- **Public Subnet**: 10.0.1.0/24 for backup gateway
- **Private Subnet**: 10.0.2.0/24 for Lambda functions
- **Data Subnet**: 10.0.3.0/24 for RDS database

### Security Features

- VPC isolation with security groups
- Encrypted storage for backups
- IAM roles with least privilege access
- CloudTrail audit logging
- Network ACLs for additional security

### Backup Strategy

- **RPO**: 4 hours (Recovery Point Objective)
- **RTO**: 2 hours (Recovery Time Objective)
- Daily automated backups with versioning
- Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
- 7-day backup retention for metadata database

## Usage

### Backup Operations

1. **Configure On-Premises Agents**: Point backup agents to the backup gateway public IP
2. **Monitor Jobs**: Use CloudWatch dashboard to monitor backup job status
3. **Restore Data**: Access restore functionality through the backup gateway

### Monitoring

- CloudWatch Logs: `/aws/lambda/corporate-backup-and-disaster-recovery-system`
- CloudTrail: Tracks all API calls and backup operations
- RDS Monitoring: Database performance and backup job metadata

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Review Backup Logs**: Check CloudWatch logs weekly
2. **Test Restore Procedures**: Monthly restore testing
3. **Update Security Groups**: Review access rules quarterly
4. **Rotate Passwords**: Update database passwords every 90 days

### Scaling Considerations

- Increase Lambda memory/timeout for larger backup jobs
- Scale RDS instance class based on metadata volume
- Add additional backup gateways for high availability

## Security Considerations

This deployment includes several security configurations that should be reviewed:

- S3 bucket public access settings
- RDS public accessibility configuration
- Network ACL rules and security group permissions
- IAM password policies and access controls
- CloudTrail encryption and log validation settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Lambda Timeout**: Increase timeout value for large backup operations
2. **RDS Connection**: Verify security group rules and subnet configuration
3. **S3 Replication**: Check IAM role permissions for cross-region access
4. **Gateway Connectivity**: Verify VPN/network connectivity to on-premises

## Cleanup

To destroy the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

**Warning**: This will permanently delete all backup data. Ensure data is backed up elsewhere before destroying.

## Compliance

This system is designed to meet:

- Corporate data retention policies
- Audit logging requirements
- Encryption standards for data at rest and in transit
- Business continuity planning requirements
