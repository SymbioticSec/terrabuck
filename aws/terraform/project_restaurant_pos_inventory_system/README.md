# Restaurant POS and Inventory Management System

This Terraform configuration deploys a comprehensive cloud-based Point of Sale system for a restaurant chain that handles order processing, payment transactions, inventory tracking, and real-time analytics.

## Architecture Overview

The system implements a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **POS Application Servers**: Auto-scaled EC2 instances hosting the main POS application
- **Inventory Database**: MySQL RDS instance for centralized inventory management
- **Transaction Storage**: S3 bucket for secure transaction logs and audit trails
- **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- **Analytics Processor**: Lambda functions for real-time data processing
- **Cache Layer**: ElastiCache Redis cluster for high-performance data access

## Network Architecture

- **Multi-AZ VPC** with public, private, and data subnets
- **Public Subnets**: Load balancer and NAT gateway
- **Private Subnets**: Application servers and cache layer
- **Data Subnets**: RDS database with isolated access

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform >= 1.0 installed
- Create a dummy Lambda deployment package:
  ```bash
  echo 'def handler(event, context): return {"statusCode": 200}' > index.py
  zip analytics_processor.zip index.py
  ```

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone and Initialize**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository>
   cd restaurant-pos-terraform
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Review and Customize Variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy and modify terraform.tfvars.example
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   # Edit terraform.tfvars with your specific values
   ```

3. **Plan Deployment**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Access the System**
   - Load balancer DNS name will be output after deployment
   - Database endpoint available in outputs for application configuration

## Configuration Variables

Key variables to customize:

- `aws_region`: AWS region for deployment (default: us-east-1)
- `environment`: Environment name (dev/staging/prod)
- `pos_instance_type`: EC2 instance type for POS servers
- `db_instance_class`: RDS instance class
- `db_username` & `db_password`: Database credentials

## Security Features

- VPC with isolated subnets and security groups
- Encrypted RDS storage and backups
- S3 bucket versioning for transaction logs
- IAM roles with least privilege access
- CloudTrail for audit logging
- Auto Scaling for high availability

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- CloudWatch logs for application monitoring
- RDS automated backups with 7-day retention
- Auto Scaling based on demand
- Performance Insights for database optimization

## Cost Optimization

- Use appropriate instance sizes for your load
- Enable S3 lifecycle policies for log retention
- Consider Reserved Instances for production workloads
- Monitor ElastiCache usage and adjust node types

## Compliance

This infrastructure is designed with PCI DSS compliance considerations:
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- Network segmentation and access controls
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Secure credential management

## Cleanup

To destroy the infrastructure:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

**Note**: Ensure you have backed up any important data before destroying resources.

## Support

For issues or questions regarding this infrastructure:
1. Check CloudWatch logs for application issues
2. Review security group configurations for connectivity problems
3. Monitor RDS performance metrics for database issues
4. Verify Auto Scaling group health for capacity problems
