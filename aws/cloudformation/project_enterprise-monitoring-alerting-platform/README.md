# Enterprise Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerting Platform

## Overview

This CloudFormation template deploys a comprehensive, production-ready monitoring and alerting platform designed for enterprise infrastructure. The system handles high-volume metric ingestion (100K+ metrics per minute), implements intelligent alerting with escalation policies, and provides real-time dashboards for IT operations teams.

## Architecture Components

### Core Services
- **Metrics Ingestion API**: Application Load Balancer handling high-throughput metric collection
- **Metrics Processing Service**: Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances for data processing and aggregation
- **Alert Engine**: Lambda function for intelligent alert processing and escalation management
- **Time Series Database**: Aurora MySQL cluster for historical metrics storage
- **Configuration Database**: RDS MySQL instance for alert rules and system metadata
- **Dashboard Storage**: S3 bucket for dashboard configurations and static assets
- **Notification Queue**: SQS queue for reliable alert delivery

### Network Architecture
- **Multi-AZ VPC** with three-tier subnet design:
  - Public subnets for load balancers
  - Private subnets for application servers
  - Data subnets for database isolation
- **NAT Gateway** for secure outbound internet access
- **Internet Gateway** for public load balancer access
