The platform integrates with existing Active Directory, provides SAML/OAuth integration for SaaS applications, and includes audit logging for compliance requirements. Features include user provisioning/deprovisioning workflows, role-based access control, and self-service password reset capabilities.",

The current fragmented approach with individual application logins creates security risks and administrative overhead. This platform will serve as the central authentication hub for all corporate applications and services.",
